## The User's

When deciding upon the purpose of my website, I thought it would be useful to create something that I can use in the future. As stated in the website, I am planning to travel to Malawi in August 2019 to volunteer with a charity called Habitat for Humanity Ireland.  Therefore, I decided to create a site that provides information on what I’m doing whilst encouraging users to donate to Habitat for Humanity Ireland. The Home page is focused upon my intention to volunteer with Habitat and what I will do while in Malawi. There is also a section about the charity that I’m volunteering with. There is only a small amount of information on the home page but an option to find out more is provided with the inclusion of a “Read More” button which leads the user to a separate page, entitled ‘About HFH’.  This allows the user to receive some initial information whilst encouraging them to explore the site further. 
To find out further information on Habitat’s work the user can click “Read more” or scroll to the second tab on the navigation bar. The user can also use the footer to navigate to the ‘About HFH’ page or any other page on the site.  The ‘About HFH’  page is separated into different sub headings including “About Habitat”, “What they do”, “Their principles and values” and “Who they help”. The concept behind the formation of this page was based on the fact that prospective donors will want to know more about the charity, before they decide to contribute. 
The third tab on the navigation bar is linked to a ‘Testimonials’ page. As the website is designed to promote my proposed volunteer trip, I thought it would be a good idea to share the perspectives of other people who have built with Habitat for Humanity in Malawi. I asked my girlfriend and her team leader to share their views on their trip that took place in summer 2018. The thought process behind the inclusion of this page is that people may be more likely to donate if they feel as though I’m doing something worthwhile.
The fourth tab on the navigation bar is called ‘Gallery’. This page has photos of the stages of the building of Habitat homes, images of the women whose family received houses last year and then general photos of villagers. I believe that the use of photos brings the work in Malawi to life and provides further insight into the families that receive Habitat homes. 
The fifth tab on the navigation bar is entitled ‘Video’. I included this page as I know that users may find it more appealing to use an audio visual aid to gain information, rather than simply reading written material. I included two videos that discuss the work that Habitat for Humanity is doing in Malawi. Both videos provide an insight into the impact that a new home can have upon the lives of orphaned and vulnerable families. 

### Features
#### The Home Page:
The Home page has been designed to inform users all they need to know about my trip.
Straight away the user will see my Logo. They will also see Links to various social media sites where they can get even more up to date information.
Scrolling down the page the user will see an image of me holding a Habitat jumper.
Just below this, users will see my blog, where I detail exactly what I am doing, what my trip is all about, when it takes place, and how much I will need to raise in order to go.
Further down the page users will see text that will briefly inform them about the charity Habitat for Humanity. If the user clicks on the read more button they will be brought to the ‘About HFH’ page where they can learn more about the charity. 
Next, users will be able to sign up for a newsletter on my fundraising journey and trip by entering their name and Email address and whatever questions they may have.
Lastly is the footer, which will allow the users to navigate to multiple pages.

#### The About HFH Page:
The About HFH page is separated into different sub headings including “About Habitat”,

## Acknowledgment: 
     I received inspiration for this project from my partner Natasha Thompson (Tash). Tash volunteered 
     with Habitat for Humanity last year and having seen her struggle with fundraising 
     I thought it would be a good idea to create a site that 
     would amalgamate information on Habitat’s work whilst promoting 
     my fundraising journey. Prior to the commencement of this project I felt very nervous 
     about the prospect of fundraising, but I genuinely believe that this site
     will help me to reach out to more people and reach my target. 
     I also wish to acknowledge the contribution of last year’s team leader, Sinead Kelly. 
     Her insight and enthusiasm are very much appreciated. 
     I would also like to thank my mentor Guido . His support throughout has been of great assistance. 
     Lastly, I would like to acknowledge my dad who encouraged me to start this course in the 
     pursuit of bettering my career prospects.
